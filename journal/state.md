# State and handoff

## Reader profile
Known (2026-11-05, from William):
- Monthly contribution about $1,000, invested as one lump sum on one day each month (day not yet chosen).
- Current IBKR balance under $1,000.
- Time horizon: none of the money is needed within 4 years; all can stay 10+ years.
- Loss tolerance: says he would keep buying through a 30% drop (stated, not yet tested; revisit after a real drawdown).
- U.S. tax resident, taxable IBKR account.
Still unknown: current holdings, IBKR fee tier and fractional share eligibility, preferred contribution day.

## Targets
50% US stock index, 25% international stock index, 20% short Treasuries/insured savings, 5% researched stocks.

## Environment limits found on 2026-11-04
- WebSearch works but returns weak, often undated aggregator pages.
- WebFetch could not reach federalreserve.gov, home.treasury.gov, or bls.gov (host not in the session's allowed domains).
  Until those are allowed, official data cannot be verified in a run.
- No live or delayed price feed. Prices must come from a cited page with a timestamp, or be reported unavailable.

## Access check 2026-11-05
Reachable: federalreserve.gov, home.treasury.gov, data.sec.gov, investor.vanguard.com, interactivebrokers.com.
Still 403: www.bls.gov, www.sec.gov (bot blocking, not the allowlist). Use data.sec.gov for filings; use BLS via other sources.

## Fund vehicles to verify (unverified, from secondary sources only)
- US stock: VTI (Vanguard Total Stock Market ETF). Expense ratio 0.03% in several secondary sources.
- International: VXUS (Vanguard Total International Stock ETF). Secondary sources disagree (0.05% to 0.08%); check Vanguard.
- Short Treasuries: not yet researched.
- IBKR availability for William's account type and country: not verified.

## Known calendar facts
- Last FOMC meeting: Oct 27-28, 2026; minutes due Nov 18 (per a Fed calendar page seen via search; not fetched directly).
- Next FOMC: Dec 8-9, 2026 (same caveat).

## Handoff for next run
1. Check whether federalreserve.gov, treasury.gov, bls.gov, sec.gov are now reachable; if so, pull the fed funds range, yield curve, and next jobs/CPI dates.
2. Verify VTI, VXUS, and one short Treasury ETF on issuer pages (expense ratio, holdings, minimums).
3. Start screening candidates from filings; no candidates yet.
4. Ask William for the profile items above if a dollar or suitability question comes up.

## Handoff 2026-11-05 (run date corrected from 2026-11-06)
- Data method that works: built-in WebFetch/WebSearch; company IR pages and SEC 8-K exhibits via WebFetch. Do not put personal details in any request or header (user instruction 2026-11-06). Avoid shell loops with dynamic URLs.
- Watchlist: ABT, LOW, PEP (see journal/watchlist_long.md). Screened 15; V, MMC, ADP failed to load.
- Next: read Abbott Q3 10-Q for debt/cash; verify LOW and PEP next earnings dates; compute PEP core EPS valuation; check CSCO; look at sectors not covered (banks, energy, industrials, utilities); verify VTI 2026-11-05 close from a second source (benchmark pending).

## Handoff 2026-11-05 run2 (clock 23:50 ET; saved as reports/2026-11-05-run2.md)
- Scheduler said 2026-11-06 but the ET clock said Nov 5. Next run: check TZ clock; if it is Nov 6 or later, write reports/2026-11-06.md replacing the correction notice.
- Done: ABT debt/cash verified; JPM and NEE added (watch). VTI baseline 360.52 on 11-05 (fell 4.35% that day; cause unknown, find a news source).
- Next: read JPM 10-Q and NEE 10-Q for credit and debt; Abbott NEC accrual note; LOW/PEP dates from company IR; PEP full year valuation; screen energy and industrials (e.g. CAT, XOM) ; compare paper prices to VTI.

## Universe screen (added 2026-11-06)
tools/screen_universe.py pulls SEC XBRL "frames" for every U.S. filer in seconds and writes data/screen_latest.csv.
First run (CY2025 data): 4,392 filers with revenue; 2,019 with complete data; 824 passed the basic quality filter.
Limits: U.S. SEC filers only (no non-U.S. exchange coverage); fundamentals only, no prices or valuation; some rows are distorted
by one-off revenue (e.g. biotech collaboration payments), so stage 2 must check each name before it is trusted.
Pipeline: stage 1 screen all filers -> stage 2 add price and valuation for the top ~50 -> stage 3 read filings for the top few -> morning compile.

## Authoritative operational handoff, method 2.0, 2026-11-06
Read RESEARCH_WORKFLOW.md and the latest dated records before following older handoffs.
The single-source VTI value mentioned above remains unverified and must not become a performance baseline.
Old markdown ratings are historical method 1.0 notes, not validated method 2.0 candidates.
The four hour worker repository attachment has been fixed. Both tasks must explicitly fetch and use claude/hopeful-hamilton-8b3avz before reading state.
Refresh the updated annual screener when metadata is missing or older than 24 hours. Its new counts may be lower because missing capex and mismatched fiscal periods are now excluded.
Next: validate the updated screener in a live worker, research one existing candidate into the structured template, run its quality checks, and prioritize unresolved evidence over adding more shallow names.
Sunday compilation includes a recorded quality review. A separate weekly ChatGPT audit will inspect actual outputs and propose or test bounded improvements.

## Worker run 2026-11-06 00:30 ET (method 2.0)
- Branch claude/hopeful-hamilton-8b3avz fast-forwarded and used. Screen refreshed (CY2025): 4,392 filers with revenue, 1,142 comparable rows, 419 preliminary passes; many exclusions are missing capex (1,029+) and mismatched dates. Not global, not valuation.
- Researched in depth: USLM and EXEL (both watch, medium confidence, scores incomplete). Third name not finished: Qualys has no Q3 10-Q yet.
- Blocker: no second independent quote origin reachable (stooq 404; only stockanalysis.com gave a dated close). Benchmark still pending; no paper references created for these names.
- Validator results saved to data/quality_latest.json. Queue is in journal/queue.md; decisions in journal/decision_log.jsonl.
- Next: get a second quote origin, read the EXEL and USLM earnings releases, watch EXEL November '039 trial outcome, then QLYS after its 10-Q.

## Worker run 2026-11-06 ~04:30 ET (method 2.0, run 2)
- Screen not refreshed (last refresh 00:26 ET, under 24 hours). QLYS still has no Q3 10-Q.
- Researched IDCC and MEDP (both watch, medium, scores incomplete). Closed the second-quote gap for USLM and EXEL: stockanalysis.com and Yahoo Finance agree on 2026-11-05 closes (publisher-level independence only). Benchmark VTI still pending; no paper references created.
- Validator: all four records valid, none attractive-eligible (data/quality_latest.json).
- Not done: FSLR; earnings release exhibits (IDCC, MEDP, USLM, EXEL); peer multiples; MEDP and IDCC annual filing financials.
- Next: FSLR valuation, QLYS after 10-Q, read releases, EXEL '039 ruling, cause of IDCC drop.
